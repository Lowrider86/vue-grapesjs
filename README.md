# Vue-GrapesJS

This project is an example of how to use Vue components in the Grapes Editor. This project is not finished yet and is not usable.

There is one essential problem right now: 
- The model is incorrect implemented. This leads to unusual behaviour inside the editor. 


## Dependencies
- GrapesJS (0.14.25)
- Vue (2.5.16)
- Vue-Router (3.0.1)
- Vuetify (1.0.19)
